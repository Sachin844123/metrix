## Overview

Packaged commodities sold in India must carry mandatory declarations under
the **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011** — net quantity,
MRP, manufacturer/packer/importer details, month & year of manufacture,
consumer care information, and more, each with prescribed formatting and
minimum font-size requirements. Verifying this manually, at the scale of
India's retail market, is slow and inconsistent.

This project is a working prototype, built for the corresponding Smart India
Hackathon problem statement, that automates the first pass of that
verification: an enforcement officer photographs a product label, and the
system extracts, validates, and reports on every mandatory declaration in
seconds — with a persistent repository, dashboard, and exportable PDF
reports to support the officer's own judgment, not replace it.

## Key Features

- **Zero manual data entry** — upload a front-of-pack photo and the product
  name, brand, and category are identified automatically (via Groq vision,
  with an OCR-based heuristic fallback) — nothing is typed in.
- **Image-based label scanning** — upload a photo of the product's
  declarations panel for automated compliance analysis.
- **OCR text & layout extraction** — corrects phone EXIF rotation, upscales
  and enhances the photo, then detects every line of printed text along
  with its position and pixel dimensions. Tuned specifically for the
  small/dense print on real product labels rather than scene text.
- **Rule-based compliance engine** — deterministic, auditable matching of
  extracted text against the mandatory declarations required by the Rules,
  including the Second Schedule font-size thresholds for net quantity and
  MRP. A typo-tolerant fuzzy matching tier catches declarations OCR noise
  would otherwise miss, before falling back to the optional AI vision check.
- **Photo quality feedback** — flags a blurry or low-resolution photo
  explicitly, rather than silently returning unreliable results.
- **AI-assisted second opinion** — an optional vision-language model reviews
  the label photo directly, recovering declarations OCR misread and flagging
  legibility issues a pixel measurement alone would miss. It can only add
  information for human review, never override a rule-engine verdict.
- **Digital compliance reports** — a formatted PDF report per scan, with the
  product photo, full declaration checklist, and an AI-written summary,
  generated on demand.
- **Repository & search** — every scan is retained with its full history,
  searchable by product name and filterable by compliance status.
- **Enforcement dashboard** — compliance rate, violation breakdown by rule,
  and recent scan activity at a glance.
- **Role-based access control** — admin, inspector, and viewer roles, backed
  by Supabase Auth; roles live in server-controlled metadata so a user can
  never self-elevate.
- **Cloud-ready storage** — labels persist to Supabase Storage and Supabase
  Postgres by default, with a zero-setup local fallback (SQLite + local
  disk) for development.

**Request pipeline for a scan:**

1. **Auth** — the frontend only ever talks to this backend's `/auth/*`
   endpoints; the backend proxies login and session verification to
   Supabase Auth, so switching identity providers never touched the
   frontend. Roles live in each Supabase user's `app_metadata`, writable
   only with the service-role key.
2. **Preprocessing + OCR** — `image_preprocessing.py` corrects EXIF
   rotation, upscales undersized photos, denoises, and contrast-enhances
   the image; EasyOCR then extracts every line of text with its bounding
   box and pixel height. Bounding boxes are scaled back to the original
   photo's pixel space so a physical mm-per-pixel calibration still gives
   correct font-size measurements after upscaling.
3. **Rule engine** — a deterministic matcher (`rule_engine.py`) checks the
   extracted text against the mandatory declarations table
   (`rules_data.py`): first with regex and a sliding-window match for
   declarations OCR splits across lines, then with a typo-tolerant fuzzy
   match against each declaration's anchor keywords for text OCR garbled
   too badly for regex, then the Second Schedule font-size thresholds.
4. **AI assist (optional)** — if configured, Groq's vision model looks at
   the photo directly as a second opinion: recovering anything OCR missed,
   flagging visible legibility issues, and writing the report summary. It
   can only move a result from "missing" to "found" for human review — it
   never overturns a verdict the rule engine already reached.
5. **Report** — ReportLab renders a PDF compliance report on demand,
   embedding the label photo and the full declaration checklist.
6. **Storage** — the label image is persisted to Supabase Storage; the scan,
   its declarations, and verdicts are persisted to Supabase Postgres.

No Docker is used anywhere — both services run directly with a Python
virtual environment and Node.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier is sufficient)

### Supabase Setup

Authentication has no local fallback — the app cannot sign anyone in without
a configured Supabase project, since accounts live in Supabase Auth rather
than a local table. The database and file storage do have local fallbacks
(SQLite and local disk) for quick experimentation, but Supabase is
recommended for both before deploying.

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. **Database** — Project Settings → Database → Connection String → URI
   tab. Use the **Session pooler** or **Transaction pooler** string, *not*
   "Direct connection" — Supabase's direct-connection hostname is
   IPv6-only, which fails to resolve on many networks
   (`could not translate host name`). Copy it into `DATABASE_URL`.
3. **Auth & Storage keys** — Project Settings → Data API for the Project
   URL, and Project Settings → API Keys for the publishable/anon key and
   the `service_role` secret key. Copy these into `SUPABASE_URL`,
   `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

The storage bucket and the default admin account are both created
automatically the first time the backend starts.

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env         # Windows: copy, macOS/Linux: cp
```

Fill in the Supabase values from the step above in `.env` (see
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for the full reference),
then start the API:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The first run creates the database tables and seeds a default admin account
in Supabase Auth (credentials in `.env.example`:
`admin@legalmetrology.gov.in` / `Admin@123` — change these before any real
deployment). Interactive API docs are served at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

> The first OCR call downloads EasyOCR's detection/recognition models
> (roughly 100 MB) — a one-time download, cached locally afterward.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and sign in with the default admin account.
`frontend/.env` sets `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to
`http://localhost:8000`).

## Environment Variables

All backend configuration lives in `backend/.env` (copy from
`backend/.env.example`).

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | No | `sqlite:///./legal_metrology.db` | SQLAlchemy connection string. Point at Supabase Postgres for a shared/production database. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | **Yes** | — | Your Supabase project URL. Required for authentication. |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | **Yes** | — | Publishable/anon key, used to validate user sessions. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Yes** | — | Secret key, used for admin user-management and Storage access. Server-side only. |
| `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | No | `label-images` | Storage bucket for uploaded label photos; created automatically. |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL` | No | `admin@legalmetrology.gov.in` | Seeded admin account email. |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No | `Admin@123` | Seeded admin account password — change before deploying. |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME` | No | `Chief Inspector` | Seeded admin account display name. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | No | `http://localhost:5173` | Comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins. |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | No | — | Enables the AI-assist layer. Free at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys). The app works fully without it. |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | No | `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | Text model used for the report summary fallback. |
| `GROQ_VISION_MODEL` | No | `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` | Vision-capable model used to review the label photo directly. |

Groq's model catalog changes over time — if a model id 404s, run
`client.models.list()` against your key to see what's currently available.

`frontend/.env` sets a single variable: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

## Using the App

1. **Sign in** as the seeded admin, or have an admin create inspector/viewer
   accounts from the **Users** page.
2. **New Scan** — upload two photos: the product's front (used to
   auto-identify the product name, brand, and category — nothing is typed
   in) and its declarations panel (checked for compliance). Optionally
   provide the panel's physical area (cm²) and a calibration factor (mm per
   pixel — e.g. by photographing a ruler alongside the label) so the
   font-size rule for net quantity can be checked precisely. Without it,
   the system still checks presence and correctness of every declaration,
   but marks font-size as "unverified" rather than failing it.
3. **Scan Detail** shows every mandatory declaration: whether it was found,
   the matched OCR text, measured vs. required font height, and a
   compliant/violation verdict per rule reference — plus a downloadable PDF
   compliance report and the AI-assisted summary.
4. **Repository** — search and filter every past scan by product name or
   compliance status, and re-open any report.
5. **Dashboard** — compliance rate, violation breakdown by rule, and recent
   scan activity for enforcement monitoring.

## Deployment

See **[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md)** for the full production deployment guide —
**Render** for the backend and **Vercel** (or Netlify) for the frontend, no
server management or Docker required, plus a post-deployment checklist and
troubleshooting for the exact issues this project has hit in practice
(Supabase's IPv6-only direct connection, pooled-connection drops, CORS
origin mismatches, and Groq model catalog changes).

## API Reference

## Limitations & Roadmap

This prototype demonstrates the full pipeline end-to-end; a production
rollout would additionally need:

- **Legal review of the rules table** — `rules_data.py` is a simplified,
  representative digitisation of the mandatory declarations and Second
  Schedule font-size thresholds. A Legal Metrology domain expert should
  verify every threshold and rule reference against the current gazette
  notification and amendments before enforcement use.
- **Physical scale calibration UX** — real deployments would want a
  standard reference object (ruler, ArUco marker, or a phone-camera focal
  length + distance estimate) captured with every photo, rather than a
  manually entered mm-per-pixel value, to make font-size checks reliable at
  scale.
- **Common/generic name & unit-sale-price extraction** are free-text fields
  that are hard to validate by regex alone; these are flagged for manual
  verification in this prototype and would benefit from a fine-tuned
  extraction model.
- **Row Level Security** on the `scans`/`declarations` tables if the
  database is ever queried directly (e.g. via Supabase client libraries)
  rather than exclusively through this backend.
