"""
Optional AI-assist layer using Groq's LLM API.

The deterministic rule engine (rule_engine.py) is the sole authority on
compliant/non-compliant verdicts - that keeps the checker auditable and
reproducible for enforcement use. Groq is used only in a supporting role,
and only ever to *add* information, never to overturn a verdict the rule
engine already reached:

  1. `identify_product` reads a front-of-pack photo to auto-fill the
     product name, brand, and category, so nothing has to be typed in
     manually.
  2. `analyze_image` sends the label photo itself to a Groq vision model as
     an independent second look - it can read declarations OCR garbled or
     split across lines, and can visually flag legibility issues (tiny
     font, low contrast) that a pixel-height measurement might miss.
  3. If the vision call is unavailable/fails, `generate_summary` still
     produces a plain-language report summary from a text-only model.

If GROQ_API_KEY is not configured, every function no-ops and the app keeps
working on rule-engine output alone.
